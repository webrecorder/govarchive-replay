## Replayweb.page Proxy UI for GovArchive.us Sites

This repo contains two aspects of the full page 'proxy' replay UI used on `*.govarchive.us` subdomains:
- The initial loading screen
- Replay banner

The UI uses wabac.js service worker and provides an alternative setup to https://replayweb.page/

This may be merged into ReplayWeb.page in the future, but for now exists as a separate repo.
